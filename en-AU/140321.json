A top-mounted selection dial provides for 6 levels of stimulation for adjustability without complexity. Pro 70 can expand to train up to 6 dogs (additional dog devices required) and features remote-operated LED beacon lights on the dog device for low light conditions and built in <a href=\"https://buy.garmin.com/en-US/US/prod114077.html\">BarkLimiter</a>, activated on the dog device, for a quieter kennel.</p>\n\n<h3>Classic, Rugged Design</h3>\n\n<p class=\"pull-quote\"><q>The PRO 70 uses the tried and true tube-shaped design that trainers have come to love.</q></p>\n\n\n<p>The PRO 70 uses the tried and true tube-shaped design that trainers have come to love, but is easy to operate (and master) 1-handed so you can keep your eyes on your dog at all times, even while switching between stimulation levels and dogs. The stimulation level/tone/LED selection dial is at the top of the handheld unit, allowing intuitive operation. And the multi-dog toggle switch and the color-coded buttons comfortably line up in the hand for fingertip control. A 2 ½-inch fixed transmitter antenna eliminates the threat of a lost or broken antenna while delivering up to 1 mile range.</p>\n\n<h3>Train with Stimulation and Tone</h3>\n\n<div style=\"float:right; width: 268px; margin: 0 0 20px 20px;\">\n<img src=\"//res.garmin.com/en/products/010-01201-00/g/pro-70-side-image-01.jpg\" style=\"margin-bottom:20px;\" width=\"268\" height=\"200\">\n<img src=\"//res.garmin.com/en/products/010-01201-00/g/pro-70-side-image-02.jpg\" width=\"268\" height=\"200\">\n</div>\n\n<p> Choose from 6 levels of continuous stimulation or a tone setting for up to 6 dogs at a time (additional dog devices required; purchase separately). Stimulation strength has been increased at the top setting for enhanced effectiveness and choice over the entire range.. You can also remotely operate the LED beacon lights, built-in to the dog device, to help locate your dog in low light conditions.</p>\n\n<h3>Built-in BarkLimiter</h3>\n<p>PRO 70 features a built-in BarkLimiter, activated by the dog device. BarkLimiter features Autorise technology, which automatically adjusts correction to the optimum level needed to stop unwanted barking.</p>\n\n<h3>Tough, Water-resistant, Long-lasting</h3>\n<p>Both the handheld transmitter and the dog device collar are designed to withstand all the blows, bumps and sloppy conditions of training and hunting. The dog device comes with 2 lengths of removable, stainless, insulated contact points for reliable performance in wet conditions and extended comfort for the dog. The dog device is <a href=\"http://www.garmin.com/en-US/legal/waterrating\">water-rated to 1 ATM</a> (10 meters). </p>\n\n<p>The PRO 70 handheld itself is <a href=\"http://www.garmin.com/en-US/legal/waterrating\">water-rated to IPX7</a>. The transmitter and dog device both feature a long-lasting, rechargeable, lithium-ion battery. A battery life indicator on the transmitter and dog device lets you know when to recharge the system. </p>\n\n<h3>Collar Pairing</h3>\n<p>PRO 70 color transmitter buttons can be paired with matching colored collars to help you keep track of which dogs are receiving stimulation and tone.
