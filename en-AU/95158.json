Not only does the GTR 225 meet the basic needs of most pilots – including adhering to new airspace requirements in Europe – but features a number of advanced features that save you time and effort.</p>\n\n<h3>Choose Your Installation</h3>\n<img alt=\"GTR 225\" src=\"https://res.garmin.com/en/products/010-00998-00/g/gtr-225/gtr-225-unit.jpg\" style=\"float:right; padding-left:30px; padding-bottom:20px;\" />\n<p>The GTR 225 is available in 3 versions to fit your needs. Two of these models are available with 25 kHz frequency channel spacing and 8.33 kHz channel spacing to meet the impending <a href=\"http://www.eurocontrol.int/articles/833-khz\" target=\"_blank\">Single European Sky mandate</a> that all aircraft in Europe will need to operate with by 2018. It&#39;s also available with either 10 W or 16 W of transmitter output, letting you find the right balance of power and price. All 3 versions include a 2-place intercom that’s ideal for 2-seat aircraft; no additional hardware is required to communicate with your passenger. Plus, remote frequency flip-flop capability can help in demanding operating environments like helicopters, letting pilots keep their hands on the controls.</p>\n\n<h3>Reduce Your Workload</h3>\n\n<p> <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://res.garmin.com/en/products/010-00998-00/g/gtr-225/identified-coms.png\" style=\"float:left; padding-right:30px; padding-bottom: 10px;\" /></p>\n\n<p>In addition to traditional Comm features, the GTR 225 incorporates a number of functions that can save you time and effort. Provide the GTR 225 with an airport identifier and it will automatically find its frequency (and vice versa) thanks to a built-in, updateable database. When installed with a compatible GPS source like our GTN or GNS series avionics, you can also view facility name and type when tuned to a valid station. You&#39;ll gain the confidence of knowing you&#39;re talking to the right controller every time. The Comm&#39;s database technology also allows you to store and recall commonly used or recently used frequencies by an assigned name. All information is displayed prominently on the device&#39;s large sunlight-readable LCD display so you can read it at a glance.</p>\n\n<h3>Never Miss a Transmission</h3>\n\n<p>With its standby frequency-monitoring feature, the GTR 225 gives you the ability to listen to ATIS while monitoring ATC. Swapping your active and standby frequencies is done with a single touch of a button. No longer will you have to worry about missing an ATC call or other critical transmission. You can also use the built-in timer to assist with approaches, holds and other assigned maneuvers. <img alt=\"Timer\" src=\"https://res.garmin.com/en/products/010-00998-00/g/gtr-225/timer.png\" style=\"float:left; padding-right:30px; padding-bottom:30px;\" /></p>\n\n<h3>Need night vision?</h3>\n\n<p>For pilots flying patrol aircraft or helicopters while using night vision goggles (NVGs) to aid visual surveillance, the GNC 255 series NAV/COMM radios are available in versions that offer NVG-compatible displays. Featuring readouts and lighting designed to suppress light waves in the red to near-infrared (NIR) spectrum, these radios screen out distracting light interference for NVG operations – while providing crisp, vivid display readability under all lighting conditions, from nighttime to bright daylight.</p>\n</div>"},"additionalTab":{"title":"Versions","content":"<table width=\"100%\" border=\"0\">\r\n<tr>\r\n  <td><table width=\"100%\" border=\"0\">\r\n    <tr>\r\n      <td><strong>DEVICE</strong></td>\r\n       <td><strong>Com</strong></td>\r\n      <td><strong>Nav</strong></td>\r\n      <td><strong>8.33kHz</strong></td>\r\n      <td><strong>Transmit Power</strong></td>\r\n    </tr>\r\n   <tr>\r\n      <td><strong>GTR 225</strong></td>\r\n      <td>X</td>\r\n      <td></td>\r\n      <td></td>\r\n      <td>10W</td>\r\n    </tr>\r\n    \r\n     <tr>\r\n      <td><strong>GTR 225A</strong></td>\r\n      <td>X</td>\r\n      <td></td>\r\n      <td>X</td>\r\n      <td>10W</td>\r\n    </tr>\r\n    \r\n    <tr>\r\n      <td><strong>GTR 225B</strong></td>\r\n      <td>X</td>\r\n      <td></td>\r\n      <td>X</td>\r\n      <td>16W</td>\r\n    </tr>\r\n  </table></td>\r\n</tr>\r\n</table>\r\n"},"inTheBoxTab":{"title":"In the Box","content":"<ul>\r\n<li>GTR 225</li>\r\n<li>Installation kit</li>\r\n<li>Manual</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n"},"accessoriesTab":{"title":"Accessories","content":null},"featuresTab":{"title":"Features","content":"<div><p><strong>Worldwide Comm Database</strong><br>\r\nEnter the airport identifier to find the frequency (or frequencies) associated with that location.
